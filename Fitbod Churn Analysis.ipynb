    "Fitbod is a fitness app that creates a daily and deeply personalized workout routine by analyzing tracked workout data. It has been popular among people who love working out. However, Fitbod also faces customer attrition problem. Thus, it is important to predict which customer is going to churn out and take marketing strategies such as sending emails that promote the product or offering incentives to prevent them from churning out. In the following analyses, based on customers' activity records, I will build a prediction model that predicts which customers will be churning out."

    "1. I first looked at the average interval of two subsequent workouts of each customer. I discovered that 87% of them have an interval of less than two weeks. Based on this finding, I define customers who haven't had any workout for more than 14 days as churned customers; \n",
    "\n",
    "2. I then looked at the usage of the 14-day period for churned and active customers; I found that the average number of exercises done by active customers is about 19.3, almost two times that of churned customers. Clearly the two groups of customers differ from each other a lot in terms of usage and thus usage within the 14-day period can be used as predictors of churn; \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Also, I suspected that active and churned customers have different preferences for muscle groups. I looked at the number of exercises done for each muscle groups by active and churned customers. The average numbers of back and quadricep exercises done by active customers are much more than that of churned customers, which indicates that the number of exercises done to improve different muscle groups are also informative of determining churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on the discoveries from the above exploratory analysis, I use the number of exercises done on each day in the previous 14 days as well as the total number of exercises done for each muscle group to predict whether a customer will churn out on the eleventh day. After tuning parameters and comparing performances of algorithms, I chose decision tree to build the model. The model can identify 93% of the actual churned customers."

First, the previous exploratory analyses have shown that there is great distinction between churned and active customers in terms of the inputted features. Having great distinction can make decision trees which are the components of random forest split nodes easily; Secondly, random forest is an ensemble model made up of random trees. It has improved model performance and less bias than decision tree; One of the biggest cons of decision tree is it is unstable and has high variance. Small changes in the training dataset can lead to big change in the structure of the decision tree. But for random forest, each tree of random forest uses a different subset of features and training data. And it uses majority votes of trees when predicting. Variance can be reduced."
